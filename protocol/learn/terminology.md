| **Project**          | Each Juicebox project is represented as an NFT (ERC-721), managed in the [`JBProjects`](../specifications/contracts/jbprojects/) contract. The owner of this NFT is specified when the project is being created. Ownership over this NFT permits admin-level interactions with the project. Like any other NFT, ownership can be transferred from the original owner to any other address, such as a multi-sig wallet or voting contract.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| **Funding cycle**    | A project's life is expressed in terms of funding cycles. A funding cycle outlines the time-locked rules according to which a project wishes to operate. It is represented as a [`JBFundingCycle`](../specifications/data-structures/jbfundingcycle.md) data structure, and managed by the [`JBFundingCycleStore`](../specifications/contracts/jbfundingcyclestore/) contract.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| **Community tokens** | <p>The Juicebox protocol keeps track of community tokens for each project. When a payment is made to a project, the protocol mints tokens for a specified beneficiary according to the rules of the current funding cycle.</p><p>Tokens are managed in the <a href="../specifications/contracts/jbtokenstore/"><code>JBTokenStore</code></a> contract. Projects can optionally call its <a href="../specifications/contracts/jbtokenstore/write/issuefor.md"><code>issueFor</code> </a>transaction to issue an ERC-20 to represent their community token. Once issued, anyone with a project's community tokens can claim them from the protocol's internal accounting mechanism into their wallet to use around Web3.</p><p>Projects can also bring their own token, so long as it adheres to the <a href="../specifications/interfaces/ijbtoken.md"><code>IJBToken</code></a> interface.</p><p>Community tokens can also be called Treasury tokens, or they may be referred to simply as a project's tokens.</p> |
| **Splits**           | A Split is used to send a percent of a total amount to a preprogrammed address, Juicebox project, or contract that inherits from [`ISplitAllocator`](../specifications/interfaces/ijbsplitallocator.md). Splits are represented with [`JBSplit`](../specifications/data-structures/jbsplit.md) data structures, and managed by the [`JBSplitStore`](../specifications/contracts/jbsplitstore/). A split does not hold information about what is being split, it's simply a structure organizable into groups that maps a receiver to a percentage.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| **Overflow**         | [`JBFundingCycle`](../specifications/data-structures/jbfundingcycle.md) data structures have a `target` property which denotes how much funds a project can pull from its treasury during the cycle to distribute to its preprogrammed payout splits. Any funds in the treasury in excess of the target is considered overflow.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| **Discount rate**    | [`JBFundingCycle`](../specifications/data-structures/jbfundingcycle.md) data structures have a `weight` property that is derived from multiplying the `weight` of the previous funding cycle by the `discountRate` of the previous cycle. The weight property can then be used to determine how many tokens are issued per unit of payment received during the funding cycle, or for any other functionality you wish to implement through your funding cycle's data sources and delegates.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| **Ballot**           | <p><a href="../specifications/data-structures/jbfundingcycle.md"><code>JBFundingCycle</code></a> data structures have a ballot property which is the address of a contract that adheres to the <a href="../specifications/interfaces/ijbfundingcycleballot.md"><code>IFundingCycleBallot</code></a> interface. This contract specifies the conditions that must be met for any proposed funding cycle reconfiguration to take effect. </p><p></p><p>A ballot contract can be written to incorporate strict community voting requirements in order to make funding cycle changes, or to simply add a required buffer period between when a change is proposed and when it can take effect.</p>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| **Redemption rate**  | [`JBFundingCycle`](../specifications/data-structures/jbfundingcycle.md) data structures configured through the [`JBController`](../specifications/contracts/or-controllers/jbcontroller/) contract have a `redemptionRate` metadata property that can be used to determine how much overflowed funds can be claimed by redeeming/burning community tokens, or for any other functionality you wish to implement through your funding cycle's data sources and delegates.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| **Reserved tokens**  | [`JBFundingCycle`](../specifications/data-structures/jbfundingcycle.md) data structures configured through the [`JBController`](../specifications/contracts/or-controllers/jbcontroller/) contract have a `reservedRate` metadata property which specifies the percentage of tokens minted as a result of newly received payments that should be reserved for distribution to a preprogrammed list of reserved token splits.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| **Data source**      | <p><a href="../specifications/data-structures/jbfundingcycle.md"><code>JBFundingCycle</code></a> data structures configured through the <a href="../specifications/contracts/or-controllers/jbcontroller/"><code>JBController</code></a> contract have a <code>dataSource</code> metadata property which is the address of a contract that adheres to the <a href="../specifications/interfaces/ijbfundingcycledatasource.md"><code>IFundingCycleDataSource</code></a> interface.</p><p></p><p>Including a data source allows projects to customize what happens when a payment is attempted to the project during a funding cycle, and what happens when a token is attempted to be redeemed during a funding cycle.</p>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |

| **Operator**         | Addresses can give permissions to any other address to take specific actions throughout the Juicebox ecosystem on their behalf. These addresses are called Operators, and are managed through the [`JBOperatorStore`](../specifications/contracts/jboperatorstore/) contract.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
