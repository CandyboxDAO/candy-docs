# Redemption rate

#### What everyone needs to know

* A redemption rate determines the proportion of treasury assets that can be aquired by a token holder by burning their tokens.
* By default, all treasury assets that are considered overflow can be redeemed for by token holders. This can be modified using data source extensions.
* A project's redemption rate and extensions can be reconfigured each funding cycle.
* A redemption rate of 100% is linear, meaning a holder of 1% of the token supply can be redeemed for 1% of available treasury assets.
* A redemption rate of x% where x < 100% will leave some proportional assets on the table to share between those who wait longer to redeem.
