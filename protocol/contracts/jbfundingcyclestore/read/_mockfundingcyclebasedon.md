**A view of the funding cycle that would be created based on the provided one if the project doesn't approve a reconfiguration ahead of it starting.**  
  
_Returns an empty funding cycle if there can't be a mock funding cycle based on the provided one._

Definition:

```javascript
function _mockFundingCycleBasedOn(JBFundingCycle memory _baseFundingCycle, bool _allowMidCycle)
  private
  view
  returns (JBFundingCycle memory) { ... }
```

* `_baseFundingCycle` is the [`JBFundingCycle`](../../../data-structures/jbfundingcycle.md) that the resulting funding cycle should follow.
* `_allowMidCycle` is a flag indicating if the mocked funding cycle is allowed to already be mid cycle.
* The view function is private to this contract.
* The function does not alter state on the blockchain.
* The function returns a mock [`JBFundingCycle`](../../../data-structures/jbfundingcycle.md) of what the next funding cycle will be.

1. A funding cycle with a `discountRate` of 201 is a non-recurring funding cycle. An empty funding cycle should be returned if the base is non-recurring since there can't be subsequent cycles.  


   _Internal references:_

   * [`_getStructFor`](_getstructfor.md)

   ```javascript
   // Can't mock a non recurring funding cycle.
   if (_baseFundingCycle.discountRate == 201) return _getStructFor(0);
   ```

2. Save a reference to the amount of seconds since right now that the returned funding cycle could have started at. There are a few possibilities.  
 

   1. If the call to the function does not `_allowMidCycle`, the start date must be now or in the future. This is also the case if the base funding cycle doesn't have a duration because the next funding cycle can start immediately. 
   2. If neither of these cases apply, moving back one full duration period of the `_baseFundingCycle` will find the most recent possible start time for the mock cycle to start.  

   _Internal references:_

   * [`_SECONDS_IN_DAY`](../properties/_seconds_in_day.md)

   ```javascript
   // The distance of the current time to the start of the next possible funding cycle.
   // If the returned mock cycle must not yet have started, the start time of the mock must be in the future so no need to adjust backwards.
   // If the base funding cycle doesn't have a duration, no adjustment is necessary because the next cycle can start immediately.
   uint256 _timeFromImmediateStartMultiple = !_allowMidCycle || _baseFundingCycle.duration == 0
     ? 0
     : _baseFundingCycle.duration * _SECONDS_IN_DAY;
   ```

3. Find the correct start time for the mock funding cycle.  


   _Internal references:_

   * [`_deriveStartFrom`](_derivestartfrom.md)

   ```javascript
   // Derive what the start time should be.
   uint256 _start = _deriveStartFrom(
     _baseFundingCycle,
     block.timestamp - _timeFromImmediateStartMultiple
   );
   ```

4. Find the correct number for the mock funding cycle.  


   _Internal references:_

   * [`_deriveNumberFrom`](_derivenumberfrom.md)

   ```javascript
   // Derive what the number should be.
   uint256 _number = _deriveNumberFrom(_baseFundingCycle, _start);
   ```

5.  Return a [`JBFundingCycle`](../../../data-structures/jbfundingcycle.md) with the aggregated configuration.  


   _Internal references:_

   * [`_idFor`](_idfor.md)
   * [`_deriveWeightFrom`](_deriveweightfrom.md)

   ```javascript
   return
     JBFundingCycle(
       _idFor(_baseFundingCycle.projectId, _number),
       _baseFundingCycle.projectId,
       _number,
       _baseFundingCycle.id,
       _baseFundingCycle.configured,
       _deriveWeightFrom(_baseFundingCycle, _start),
       _baseFundingCycle.ballot,
       _start,
       _baseFundingCycle.duration,
       _baseFundingCycle.target,
       _baseFundingCycle.currency,
       _baseFundingCycle.fee,
       _baseFundingCycle.discountRate,
       0,
       _baseFundingCycle.metadata
     );
