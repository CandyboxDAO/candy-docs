{% tab title="Step by step" %}
**Finds the last funding cycle that was permanent in relation to the specified funding cycle.**  
  
_A permanent funding cycle is one with a \`cycleLimit\` of 0 is, or one that isn't based on any previous funding cycle._

_If the provided cycle is permanent, it will be returned._

# Definition

```solidity
function _latestPermanentCycleFrom(JBFundingCycle memory _fundingCycle)
  private
  view
  returns (JBFundingCycle memory fundingCycle) { ... }
```

* Arguments:
  * `_fundingCycle` is the [`JBFundingCycle`](../../../data-structures/jbfundingcycle.md) to get the latest permanent cycle from.
* The view function is private to this contract.
* The function does not alter state on the blockchain.
* The function returns the latest permanent funding cycle. If the provided cycle is permanent, it will be returned.

# Body 

1. If the provided `_fundingCycle` has a `cycleLimit` of 0, or if it isn't `basedOn` another funding cycle, return it.

   ```solidity
   // A funding cycle with no cycle limit, or one not based on another funding cycle is, implicitly permanent.
   if (_fundingCycle.basedOn == 0 || _fundingCycle.cycleLimit == 0) return _fundingCycle;
   ```

2. Get a reference to the base funding cycle.

   ```solidity
   // Get the funding cycle of the base funding cycle.
   fundingCycle = _getStructFor(_fundingCycle.basedOn);  
   ```

3. Recurse through this function with the base funding cycle until a permanent one is found.

   ```solidity
   // Recursively check if the previous cycle is permanent.
   return _latestPermanentCycleFrom(fundingCycle);
   ```
