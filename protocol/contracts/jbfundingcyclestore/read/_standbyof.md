**The project's stored funding cycle that hasn't yet started, if one exists.**

_A value of 0 is returned if no funding cycle was found._

Definition:

```solidity
function _standbyOf(uint256 _projectId) private view returns (uint256 fundingCycleId) { ... }
```

* `_projectId` is the ID of a project to look through for a standby cycle.
* The view function is private to this contract.
* The function does not alter state on the blockchain.
* The function returns an ID of a standby funding cycle if one exists, or 0 if one doesn't exist.



1.  Get a reference to the latest funding cycle for the project.\


    _Internal references:_

    * [`latestIdOf`](../properties/latestidof.md)

    ```solidity
    // Get a reference to the project's latest funding cycle.
    fundingCycleId = latestIdOf[_projectId];
    ```


2.  If there isn't a funding cycle for the project, there isn't a standby cycle either.

    ```solidity
    // If there isn't one, theres also no standby funding cycle.
    if (fundingCycleId == 0) return 0;
    ```


3.  Get the struct for the latest funding cycle.\


    _Internal references:_

    * [`_getStructFor`](\_getstructfor.md)

    ```solidity
    // Get the necessary properties for the latest funding cycle.
    JBFundingCycle memory _fundingCycle = _getStructFor(fundingCycleId);
    ```


4.  If the cycle has started, return 0 since there is not a stored funding cycle in standby.

    ```solidity
    // There is no upcoming funding cycle if the latest funding cycle has already started.
    if (block.timestamp >= _fundingCycle.start) return 0;
    ```
