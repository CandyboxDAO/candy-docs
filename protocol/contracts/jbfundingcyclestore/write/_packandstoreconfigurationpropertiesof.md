```javascript
function _packAndStoreConfigurationProperties(
  uint256 _fundingCycleId,
  uint256 _configured,
  uint256 _cycleLimit,
  IJBFundingCycleBallot _ballot,
  uint256 _duration,
  uint256 _currency,
  uint256 _fee,
  uint256 _discountRate

```

* `_fundingCycleId` is the ID of the funding cycle to pack and store.
* `_configured` is the timestamp of the configuration.
* `_cycleLimit` is the number of cycles that this configuration should last for before going back to the last permanent.
* `_ballot` is the ballot to use for future reconfiguration approvals. 
* `_duration` is the duration of the funding cycle.
* `_currency` is the currency of the funding cycle.
* `_fee` is the fee of the funding cycle.
* `_discountRate` is the discount rate of the base funding cycle.
* The function is private to this contract.
* The function doesn't return anything.
