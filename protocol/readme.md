# README

Welcome all curious developers to the Juicebox V2 protocol docs!

The goal of this section is for you to find any protocol related information that you're looking for. Whether you're auditing, developing your own JB project, creating your own JB extensions, looking for bug bounties, or just looking to learning some solidity, these docs should give you just what you're looking for. If you're super curious about how the protocol works, these docs should allow you to click around and get a real deep dive. You should just as easily be able to find overview information.

Looking for general guides on how the protocol works? See the [Learn](learn/overview.md) section.

Looking for an outline of the protocol's API, or a deep dive on each line of code in the project? Click around in the [Contracts](contracts/) section. There are bug bounties posted for each documented function.

All contracts are fully documented with the exception of `JBController` `JBETHPaymentTerminal` and `JBETHPaymentTerminalStore`. These are WIP and will be wrapped up in the coming week. There will also be several more deep dive tutorials written about how you can use `IJBFundingCycleDataSource` , `IJBPayDelegate`, `IJBRedemptionDelegate` and `IJBFundingCycleBallot `to pull off creative custom treasury strategies, and posts explaining how to forward funds from your own smart contracts into Juicebox projects.
