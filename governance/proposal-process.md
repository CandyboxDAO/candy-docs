# Proposal Process

## Step 1 - Idea

When a community member wants to present an idea, the first thing they should do is use a [proposal template](https://juiceboxdao.notion.site/juiceboxdao/Governance-f0ff06c503914500acb9bd646cc4ed65) to create a proposal and post it in the proposal **discord** channel. A thread should then be created for community discussion.   

## Step 2 - Discussion 

Next, the **discord** community is given **2 days** to discuss the proposal. During this time, changes to the proposal can be made with the consent of the community and proponent. 

## Step 3 - Temperature Check

After discussion, a **"react to vote"** **poll** is made in the proposals channel. The temp check must include the proposal contents as well a link to the discussion thread. If the poll obtains at least **30% approval** over **2 days** from a minimum of **10 discord members**, then the proposal is passed onto the next step. 

## Step 4 - Voting Off-Chain

If the proposal passes all of the requirements of the temp check, then a **Snapshot Vote** is created. The Snapshot must include the full proposal content, the link to the temp check, and the link to the discussion thread. If there is at least **50% approval** from **20 or more addresses** over **2 days**, ****then the proposal is passed to the final step. 

Snapshot representation strategy depends on the proposal template being used. Some types of proposals are conducted by JBX holders, others are conducted by contributors.

## Step 5 - Execution 

Once the Snapshot voting is ended, a **Gnosis multi-sig** executes the results of the proposal on-chain. This process should take no longer that **2 days.**
