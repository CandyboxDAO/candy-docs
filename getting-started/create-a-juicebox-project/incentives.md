# Incentives

**Incentives** consists of _Discount rate_ and _Bonding curve rate._

* _Discount rate_ changes the cost of issuing **tokens** over time. Each funding cycle, the amount of tokens issued for each ETH will decrease by the discount rate. Generally, this will reward people who fund your project earlier.
* _Bonding curve rate_ changes the amount of overflow that each token can be redeemed for. A _Bonding curve rate_ of 60% means that tokens can be redeemed for 60% of the value they correspond to, thereby increasing the relative value of other tokens and rewarding long-term token holders.
