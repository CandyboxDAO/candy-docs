# Create a Juicebox Project

Welcome folks! First, press the 'connect' button in the top right corner of the homepage to connect your wallet to Juicebox. After this you will click on 'Design your Project' or scroll down the homepage. On the right, you will see a preview of the project. and on the left, you will see the sections menu. 

## `Section 1 - Identity`

Complete as much as possible of the Identity Section of the project. Later changes to this field will cost gas. 

## `Section 2 - Funding`

The Funding Section consists of picking a funding target and a funding cycle duration. 

* **Funding Targets** are financial goals set for your project. The money invested into your project is placed into your treasury and creates tokens. If at any point the balance of the treasury is larger than the target funding you have set, then the access is called overflow. Anyone that has tokens can redeem them for a % of the overflow based on the bonding curve \(check out Section 6 - Incentives for more info on the bonding curve\). Having a Funding Target is required in order to have and Incentives Section. 
* The **Funding Period** determines how often you can withdraw your target amount. Not having a Funding Period allows you to withdraw money from the project anytime. 

  Team payments and fixed monthly costs should be considered when creating a funding target and funding period. 

## `Section 3 - Spending`

The Spending Section is where you can determine how to distribute money within the system. These can consist of payments to wallets or to other Juicebox projects. This also allows for a lock date which holds payments until a specific date or until the funding cycle is edited. 

* The % that you select is relative to the funding target you have set. These payouts will be will be available to distribute every time a new funding cycle begins. 

## `Section 4 - Reserved Tokens`

The Reserved Tokens are the amount of tokens generated by each payment made to the project that are going to be reserved to some assigned addresses that are determined for every funding cycle. Here, you can set the % of tokens that will be reserved and who is going to get them in what %. 

* Let's assume that at a certain point, 1 ETH generates 100 tokens on your project. Let's say you set **Reserved tokens** to 10% and add two of your developers, giving them 50% each. When someone invests 1 ETH in the project, the investor gets 90 tokens and each of the devs get 5. 

## `Section 5 - Rules` 

The Rules section is where you can choose the length of time before changes in a funding cycle can be implemented. 

* Option 1 is a seven day delay meaning changes to the next funding cycle must be submitted seven days before it goes live. This allows for clarity and an opportunity for the proposition to be analyzed. 
* Option 2 is setting no delay to implement a change to the funding cycle. This can be dangerous as immediate changes can allow for dangerous activities such as rug pulls. 
* Option 3 is a customized contract where you can set your own rules for funding cycle reconfiguration. 

## `Section 6 - Incentives` 

This section will only appear if you have set a funding target. The Incentives Section is where you set parameters to define advantages of early investors and of investors who take longer to redeem their tokens. The simplified version is self explanatory, but it is recommended that you understand the advanced settings as well.  The settings include two variables: the Discount Rate \(DR\) and the Bonding Curve \(BC\). 

* The **Discount Rate** \(DR\) defines how quickly token production depreciates per amount of ETH. If 1 ETH generates 100 tokens in the cycle \#1, and the DR is 20%, then 1 ETH is going to generate 80 tokens in cycle \#2. If this rate is kept, cycle \#3 will generate 64 tokens. This compound system always applies the percentage over the value of the next cycle. The applied rates are not reversible so progress carefully. The main goal here is to support and incentivize early investors for the risk they take by investing.
* The **Bonding Curve** \(BC\) defines how much ETH from your balance the token holders will be getting if they redeem their tokens from the overflow. 100% is a 1:1 proportion meaning if they got 1% of tokens, they can redeem 1% of money in the overflow. The lower the value goes, the less someone can take from the overflow. This mechanism rewards people that stay invested in the project longer. 
* These two rates can set real advantages for early supporters who stay with you for the longest amount of time. You should have careful consideration with these for they can also make a project uninteresting to later investors depending on how they are set. These tools should be carefully evaluated as they can easily make or break a project.
