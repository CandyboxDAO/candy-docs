# Creating a Candybox Project

{% hint style="warning" %}
The Candybox protocol is not formally audited. All projects built on it may be vulnerable to bugs or exploits. Be smart and be curious, ask questions if you've got any.
{% endhint %}

To create a Candybox Project, press 'connect' in the top right corner of the [homepage](http://candybox.money) to connect your wallet.

Next, click on 'Design your Project' or scroll down. The left side of the project design wizard shows you all the necessary configuration steps, and the right side previews what your project will look like once created.

{% hint style="info" %}
Consider creating a test project on the bscTestnet testnet version of Candybox at [bscTestnet.candybox.money](http://bscTestnet.candybox.money) before creating project on BNB Chain(BSC) mainnet. To use the bscTestnet version of Candybox, you'll have to change your wallet to the bscTestnet network.
